### **** the documentation is a Work in progress (not the browser :) ****

Cromite is a [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home) fork based on [Bromite](https://github.com/bromite/bromite) with built-in support for ad blocking and an eye for privacy.

Cromite is available for Android Marshmallow and above (v6.0, API level 23) and Windows.

For the Frequently Asked Questions see [F.A.Q.](./FAQ.md).

For documentation see the [wiki](https://github.com/bromite/bromite/wiki).

# Goals

Cromite's goal is to
- limit the features built into the browser that can be used as a platform for tracking users' habits, and, if it is not technically possible, disable them and leave it up to the user to choose whether to re-enable them
- limit the close integration between the browser and its manufacturer
- not let the excellent research work done by csagan5 with Bromite be lost

In addition, Cromite would like to promote greater integration with other non-profit, open source browsers, encouraging closer collaboration with others, and attempt to integrate them directly into Chromium once they have reached an appropriate level of maturity.

# Privacy limitations

Cromite's privacy features, including anti-fingerprinting mitigations (which are not comprehensive), **are not to be considered useful for journalists and people living in countries with freedom limitations**, please look at [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/) in such cases.
Please note that this project is not free of bugs and that changing the behaviour of a browser can be risky and not without problems.

# Releases

All built versions are available as [releases](https://github.com/uazo/cromite/releases).

Cromite is currently built for ARM64, ~x86~ (Android SDK version 23+) and Windows x64.

You will automatically receive notifications about new updates (and be able to install them) via the auto updater functionality (enabled by default), see [related wiki page](https://github.com/bromite/bromite/wiki/AutomaticUpdates).

For F-droid: work in progress https://github.com/uazo/cromite/issues/64

### Auto-update setup for windows

1. Download https://github.com/henrypp/chrlauncher/releases
2. Create a `chrlauncher.ini`

```
[chrlauncher]

# Custom Chromium update URL (string):
ChromiumUpdateUrl=https://github.com/uazo/cromite/releases/latest/download/updateurl.txt

# Command line for Chromium (string):
# note --user-data-dir= works better if path is absolute
# See here: http://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/
ChromiumCommandLine=--user-data-dir=".\User Data" --no-default-browser-check

# to enable full logging in c:\temp\log.txt (daily rotate, no automatic deletion)
# ChromiumCommandLine=--enable-logging --v=0 --log-file=C:\temp\log.txt --user-data-dir=".\User Data" --no-default-browser-check

# Chromium executable file name (string):
ChromiumBinary=chrome.exe

# Chromium binaries directory (string):
# Relative (to chrlauncher directory) or full path (env. variables supported).
ChromiumDirectory=.\bin
```

### Enable network process sandbox in windows
I don't include any setups because I don't like the experience of not knowing what they do, so you must manually run this command on first installation:
```
cd <where_is_the_exe>
icacls . /grant "*S-1-15-2-2:(OI)(CI)(RX)"
```
see https://github.com/uazo/bromite-buildtools/issues/51

## (TODO) Integrity and authenticity

You can verify the integrity of a downloaded APK file from this project with any `sha256sum`-compatible tool by downloading the corresponding `brm_X.Y.Z.sha256.txt` or `chr_X.Y.Z.sha256.txt` file, where X.Y.Z is the release version number. Example:
```
$ sha256sum --check brm_68.0.3440.54.sha256.txt
arm64_SystemWebView.apk: OK
arm64_ChromePublic.apk: OK
arm64_ChromeModernPublic.apk: OK
```

You can verify authenticity, e.g. that the author ([csagan5](https://github.com/csagan5)) released the file, by using gpg2:
```
$ gpg2 --quiet --verify brm_68.0.3440.54.sha256.txt.asc
gpg: assuming signed data in 'brm_68.0.3440.54.sha256.txt'
gpg: Signature made Sun 08 Jul 2018 04:22:52 PM CEST using RSA key ID D85DC0C5
gpg: Good signature from "csagan5 <32685696+csagan5@users.noreply.github.com>"
```

You can download csagan5's public GnuPG key from here: [csagan5.asc](./csagan5.asc).

# (TODO) How to build

The [Bromite main repository](https://github.com/bromite/bromite) contains tags for each corresponding Chromium release (see https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git).

Please refer to [official Chromium build documentation](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/get-the-code) to get started on how to build Chromium; if you can build Chromium for Android, you can build Bromite.

The Chromium version tag used as base for the patches is available here: [RELEASE](./build/RELEASE); this is always corresponding to the git tag for every release.
The GN args used to build Bromite are available here: [bromite.gn_args](./build/bromite.gn_args).
The patches are to be applied second the order specified in the `bromite_patches_list.txt` file (you can use `git am`).

# (TODO) Contributing

Please submit issues following the issue template; beware that GitHub does not display the templates from mobile.

Patches are welcome and accepted if they match the project goals.

For any usage or development discussion please use GitHub Discussions: https://github.com/bromite/bromite/discussions
